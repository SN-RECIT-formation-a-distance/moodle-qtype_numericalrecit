The "formulas with steps" question allows the teacher to administer a test in a digital format that contains questions that require the assessment of steps. This type of question allows for direct photo taking through any type of current device (laptop, Chromebook, tablet, mobile device). The student also has the option to attach a file. A table of values generates random numbers presented to the students. Therefore, each student receives a unique version of the test. The table of values ensures fairness through the set of random values. A mathematical formula is applied to provide the student and the teacher with the correct answer. The problem can contain several steps. Automated feedback regenerates the value set to inform the expected approach. The correction of the question is manual and the evaluator can provide a comment in text or audio format. It is hoped that this type of question will contribute to equity between students in the classroom and those at home during an assessment.

The RECIT formulas question is based on the formulas question for the creation of mathematical fields.
